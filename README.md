## Data Modeling
I reviewed the CSV files given and I created a database model and linked all of the primary keys and foreign keys.
## Data Engineering
After the modeling, I created each table with all of the primary and foreign keys that I thought were appropriate, then I matched the column headers with the column headers in each CSV and imported the data.
## Data Analysis
After the data engineering portion, I used the query functions we learned in class to find each query the taask asked for.
